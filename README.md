1st task > Please merge the two datasets. Some records might not have corresponding assignments, however please keep them in the merged dataset.

My suggestion is that the merge has the target to compare the both records of Employees and Visitors. In my opinion unifying floor sensors from employees records with visited floors from the visitors is a good idea.

2nd task > Please tell me what you have observed during the process of merging the two data sets. Any concern with the data quality? Feel free to point out any anomaly.

I have to find out how to fix the separation of the first columns. May be the csv format is not the good one for this merge. I don't have enough experience with such kind of date sets without equal indexes. I made some research but it'll take more time. May be SQL offer more reasonable solution. I have to check. In my opinion the format of the IDs both employees and visitors have to be unyfied in case of competing the data records for the both groups or to generate an additional code for the current purposes. Also there is a NULL values.  

3th task > (Optional) Summarize the date range of the badge data and point out the days where you see an unusually low/high number of records.
  
Working days have a high number of records according to weekends (and off course Friday 13th). Approx 7 times high. 

Time for research - 55 min

Time for code - 35 min
